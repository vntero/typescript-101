# typescript-101
This repository will be used for playing around with TS on multiple projects and multiple levels

# Concepts that will be covered
* # Basics
1) Core types, Type Assignment and Type Inference
2) Objects
3) Arrays
4) Tuples (fixed length arrays)
5) Custom type Enum
6) Type any
7) Union type
8) Literal types
9) Void
10) Function as types
11) Unknown type and Never type
* # Compiler and configuration
* # Classes and Interfaces
1) Creating a first class
2) Constructor Functions and the this keyword
3) private and public Access Modifiers
4) Shorthand initialization and readonly properties
5) Inheritance
6) Getters and Setters
7) Static Methods and Properties
8) Abstract Classes
9) Singletons and Private Constructors
10) Interfaces in Classes: interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They can also be used inside of a class, something not achievable with type
* # Advanced Types
1) Intersection Types
2) Type Guards
3) Discriminated Unions
4) Type Casting
5) Function Overloads
* # Generics
Generics are types that are connected to other types where we want to know which other type that is for better support from TypeScript. It's a way of specifying which type of data will be provided within a type. Generics allow Arrays to know what they store and Promises to know what they will return. They help us to get additional type information, specially when we have a more complex function that does something with the data that's coming in and we want to be more assured of the outcome. 
1) Built-in generics
2) Creating a generic function
3) Generic Utility Types
4) Generic Classes
* Decorators
* Namespaces and modules

# Enhancers
* eslint extension
* prettier extension
* Webpack or Vite is still to be decided...
